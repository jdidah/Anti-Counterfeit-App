BLOCKCHAIN BASED SYSTEM TO COUNTERACT COUNTERFEIT GOODS

The rise of counterfeit goods calls for the need to come up with a solution to combat the practice. This is a block chain based system that will be used to track the link in the supply chain from the manufacturer of the product, to freight, to customs, to transport, to distributors (wholesalers and retailers) and finally to the consumers using block chain property of being a decentralized ledger that is capable of storing a complete history of transactions on a shared database. 
This will contribute information to a network and therefore prove the origin of the product, trace its ownership and provide authentication. 
The solution is viable since the information in the ledger can be accessed from anywhere using a smart phone.
The products will be assigned with unique cryptographically protected identifiers during production and can be verified using a mobile application that scans the QR code and gives basic details of the product such as model, date of manufacture and expiry date for perishable products. At every change of hands a scan of the QR code will be done, from the consumerâ€™s end they perform the scan for verification and at the same time and update is made to the block chain database.
The Track and Trace tags, labels, codes may not be immune to copying or falsification, but its security is greatly enhanced by the inclusion of unique and apparently random serialization, or non-predictable numbering, ideally at individual item level. 
Individual packs may still be copied, but the system will identify duplicates or invalid serial numbers, as well as those which have been cancelled or expired, or which appear in the wrong market, or with invalid product details.
